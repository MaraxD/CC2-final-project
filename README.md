One

## Description
Humans are not solitary beings. We need one another to thrive and evolve. Yet, somewhere along the way, we’ve forgotten our innate interdependence — both with each other and with the world that surrounds us. “One” is an interactive installation designed to rekindle this sense of connection, encouraging people to collaborate in order to create a shared experience. 

“One” features a large, tactile surface that participants are invited to explore. Touching its conductive elements activates visual effects inspired by natural elements, accompanied by a gentle soundscape. The true experience lies in the heart of collaboration.
